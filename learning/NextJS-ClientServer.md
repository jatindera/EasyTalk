ðŸ”’ Enhancing Security and Control with Client-to-Server Communication in Next.js ðŸ”’

When building modern web applications, it's crucial to ensure data security and maintain clean, scalable architecture. Hereâ€™s why routing API calls through Next.js server-side middleware before hitting backend services is a smart move:

Security: Hide backend infrastructure like FastAPI from the client to reduce exposure to attacks.
Token Management: Keep sensitive data (e.g., access tokens) on the server, minimizing client-side risks.
Server-Side Control: Add validation, error handling, or rate limiting on the server before forwarding requests.
Centralized API Handling: Manage calls to multiple backend services through a single Next.js entry point.
Separation of Concerns: Cleanly separate client-side UI from server-side business logic and backend communication.
Integrating this pattern into your app helps you enhance both security and scalability. ðŸ’¡
